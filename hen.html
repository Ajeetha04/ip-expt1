<li>A chicken has two legs, two wings, two eyes, a beak, and a crest on its forehead.</li>
<li> Chickens cannot fly unevenly like other birds, they can only fly at low altitudes for a very short time. The whole body of the chicken is covered with small feathers.</li>
<li>Male bird is called a rooster and a female is called a hen.</li>
<li>Hens sit on their eggs and incubate them, and after a few days, the chicks emerge from these eggs.</li>
<li>In addition to eggs, a hen is also a source of meat. Like eggs, meat is also consumed by humans across the world. It is because of hens that India is able to meet the demands of the growing population.</li>
